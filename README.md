# 🧩 Maze Pathfinding Visualization

This project is a graphical application that generates and visualizes maze pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to view the maze generation process, the exploration of paths, and the final solution computed by the algorithm. The application uses Python and `Tkinter` for the graphical interface, making it an educational and interactive tool for understanding maze and pathfinding concepts.

# Features:
 **Maze Generation 🏗️**:
    The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm. It consists of walls 🧱 and open paths 🚶‍♂️, ensuring a dynamic maze layout that can be generated with         adjustable sizes. The maze is represented by a grid of cells, with walls and paths visually distinct. 🏢🔲
    
 **Pathfinding Algorithms 🛤️**:
The app implements three popular pathfinding algorithms:
    A* (A-star) 🌟: Finds the shortest path using a combination of actual distance and heuristic estimates to the goal. 🚀
    BFS (Breadth-First Search) 🧭: Explores the maze level by level, ensuring an optimal solution for unweighted mazes. 🌊
    DFS (Depth-First Search) ⛏️: Explores deep into the maze, backtracking when no further moves are possible. 🌳 
Each algorithm’s progress is shown by highlighting             explored nodes 🔍 and final paths ➡️.

    
**Interactive User Interface 🖱️**:
    The intuitive GUI allows users to generate a maze, select a pathfinding algorithm, and watch the solution unfold. Real-time updates show each algorithm’s exploration and     pathfinding process. 🖼️💻
    
**Sound Effects 🔊**:
    The pygame library adds sound effects 🎶 that play during algorithm execution and pathfinding steps, making the visualization more engaging.


# 📦 Technologies Used
- Programming Language : Python 🐍
- GUI Framework : Tkinter 🖥️

# 📖 How It Works
1. **🔨 Maze Creation**: A maze is generated programmatically by carving paths between walls.
2. **🧩 Pathfinding**: An algorithm explores the maze, visualizing the search process in real time.
3. **🏆 Solution Display**: Once the goal is reached, the path is drawn and displayed. 


## 🎯 Use Cases
- **🎓 Educational Tool**: Ideal for teaching and understanding maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.
- **🤖 Algorithm Demonstration**: Provides a step-by-step visual explanation of search algorithms.
- **🧑‍🏫 Interactive Learning**: Engages users in exploring and solving mazes visually.
